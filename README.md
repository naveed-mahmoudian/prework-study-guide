# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Because first-time coders will likely have a difficult time learning all there is to know about software development, I've created this study guide webpage as a tool to help keep track of thier notes. Through this process, it not only helps the user but also the developer (me) understand how a basic interactive webpage application works.
